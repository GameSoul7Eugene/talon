Simple utility to debloat Windows in 2 clicks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Talon is designed to be used on **freshly installed Windows 11 systems**. Trying to use Talon on an already in-use system, or any older versions of Windows, is not guaranteed to work and can cause some apps to stop working properly and system corruption!

## Installation
You can download the latest version of Talon from [here](https://debloat.win). Ensure that you temporarily whitelist your C: drive on Windows during the installation process to prevent Windows Defender from intervening.

To compile from source, make sure you have Python 3.12.4, install the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`, then run `build.bat`. **Please note that, when building from source, you are building the absolute latest version of the code (even newer than the most recent release)**!

# Documentation
Documentation is available [here](https://docs.ravendevteam.org/talon).
